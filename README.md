# FakeNewsProject
The goal of this project is to create a fake news prediction system. Fake news is a major problem that can have serious negative effects on how people understand the world around them. You will work with a dataset containing real and fake news in order to train a simple and a more advanced classifier to solve this problem. This project covers the full Data Science pipeline, from data processing, to modelling, to visualization and interpretation.
